# Final-Research-Project

The final year project was developed to address lack of health literacy in patients regarding medical test report results. I developed a web application to predict and get summarized information about the prediction made about medical test report results using machine learning. I have used Random Forest akgorithm for the model of the system. Frontend is developed using React Js and Material UI framework and backend is developed using Python and Flask framework.
